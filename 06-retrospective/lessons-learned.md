# Lessons Learned

## What worked
- Clear steps-to-reproduce and consistent bug template
- Risk-based prioritization (P0 first)

## What I’d improve next
- Expand device coverage (mobile)
- Add re-test notes once fixes exist

## Relevant background
I previously worked in a multi-round quality workflow (R1 → optional R1b → R2 cross-check),
including weekly check-ins and team calibration discussions for tool-specific differences.
