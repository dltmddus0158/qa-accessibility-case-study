# Lessons Learned

## Process Reflection
This case study reinforced the value of a structured QA workflow,
including clear scoping, risk-based prioritization, and reproducible documentation.

The approach was informed by prior experience in multi-round remediation workflows
(R1 → optional additional pass → R2 cross-checking),
emphasizing independent review and quality validation.

## What Worked Well
- Narrow scope allowed for deeper analysis
- Accessibility-first testing surfaced meaningful issues early
- Consistent documentation improved clarity and reviewability

## Opportunities for Improvement
- Expand testing to mobile navigation scenarios
- Include re-test documentation if fixes are implemented
- Broaden accessibility coverage beyond navigation and search
