- Priority: P1

## Affected Users
- First-time users unfamiliar with search behavior
- Keyboard-only users
- Users with cognitive disabilities who rely on clear system feedback

## WCAG Reference

2. Do not enter any text

  (e.g., inline message, placeholder instruction, or validation prompt)

## Actual Result

- Page state appears unchanged, leaving the user uncertain

## Impact
- Users may believe the search feature is broken
