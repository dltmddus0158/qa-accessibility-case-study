## Environment
- OS: macOS
- Browser: Chrome
- Input method: Keyboard only
- Date: 2026-01-XX

## Severity / Priority
- Severity: S2 (Major accessibility issue)
- Priority: P0

## Affected Users
- Keyboard-only users
- Users with low vision
- Users with motor impairments relying on visible focus cues

## WCAG Reference
- **WCAG 2.1 – Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible**
  > Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.

## Preconditions

- User navigates without a mouse

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Load the homepage
2. Press the `Tab` key repeatedly to move through the global navigation menu
3. Observe the visual focus indicator on each menu item

## Expected Result
- The currently focused menu item has a clearly visible focus indicator
- Focus styling has sufficient contrast and is easily distinguishable from surrounding elements

## Actual Result
- Focus indicator is subtle and blends into the background
- Users may have difficulty identifying which menu item is currently focused

## Impact
- Users navigating via keyboard may lose track of their position within the navigation
- Increases cognitive load and risk of incorrect navigation
- Creates a barrier to efficient access for users who rely on keyboard navigation
